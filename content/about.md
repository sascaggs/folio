I am a PhD candidate in the Anthropology department at The Ohio State University. As a graduate research fellow in the Human Complexity Lab, I study the social and ecological dynamics of human subsistence activities (e.g., foraging, cultivation, exchange). To understand these dynamics, I combine ethnographic and ecological fieldwork with quantitative methods (e.g. network analysis, statistical modeling). I have received funding support for my research from my home department, the Tinker Foundation, and the National Science Foundation.
