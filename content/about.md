# **Shane A. Scaggs**

I am a PhD candidate in the Anthropology department at The Ohio State University. As a graduate research fellow in the Human Complexity Lab, I am broadly interested in the entangled social and ecological dynamics of human subsistence activities (e.g., foraging, cultivation, exchange). To understand these dynamics, I combine ethnographic and ecological fieldwork with quantitative methods. I have received funding support for my research from my home department, the Tinker Foundation, and the National Science Foundation. Check out my [CV](/cv/) for additional details about my work. 

I am the co-director of the [Social Ecological Networks Group](https://seng.netlify.app) (SENG) -- a graduate student led learning collective that focuses on using network science to understand social and ecological phenomena. We hold open meetings in a virtual format where we discuss new research, provide feedback to each other on project ideas, and share network analysis and coding skills. The long-term goal of SENG (sen-jee) is to develop open access teaching material that instructors and professors can use to introduce students to network science.
